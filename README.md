# OpticalCharacterRecognition
Goal was to take a photo of a book cover and have the Open CV's library with Tesseract OCR engine to convert a book title into text/strings from an image. Consists of an image preprocessor which converts images to grayscale and makes them more readable for computer vision. Uses the Tesseract OCR engine, but unfortunately, this program spits out gibberish instead of coherent text. Most likely because it can't handle a lot of surrounding colorful or contrasting elements. Or failed to incorporate something in my image preprocessor.
